Since this is a public data, there are some missing datapoints, plus the probability of existence of outliers. It is well known that it is imperative in decline curve analysis to detect and exclude outliers. Large prediction errors is very well possible otherwise. "

    "As we need to calculate EUR per well, first thing to consider is to choose an appropriate model for history matching of the given data, which comes from the Bakken formation, an unconventional field. It has been shown that conventional models such as Arp's equations often lead to overestimation of EUR in unconventioanl resources (Paryani et al., 2018). It has been reported (Clark et al., 2011) that Logistic Growth Analysis (LGA) can more accurately capture production history of unconventional resources. Therefore, I would use LGA in this analysis."

    "Since each well is going to be individually fitted with a model, it is important to consider whether all of them are eligible to calibrate a model. Having just a few data points can easily overfit a model (with 2 or 3 parameters) and be misleading. For the sake of this analysis, I would only use wells with 6 or more months of production history in model calibration (even 6 data points still looks small, but we need to compromise between losing information and accuracy).  \n",
    "Regarding those with less than 6 months of production, if it has been a notable time since their last operation activity, I would believe that its operator found it as a bad well and just left it. Their cumulative productions are used as their EUR and included in this analysis. Other wells with a short production history that are recently drilled and started producing in 2018 are not included here."

Since 2013, they have only drilled one well every other year. Their yearly productions have decreased consistently since 2012. In total they have produced the least amount of oil (5.74 million barrels).\n",

    "- *SLAWSON EXPLORATION COMPANY INC*: They were mostly drilling for 5 years (2011-2016) with an average of 9 well completions per year. They stopped drilling any wells for two years and recently drilled a new one. Their annual productions increased until 2016 and then declined. They have produced an aggregate of 6.52 million barrels.\n",

While **ENERPLUS RESOURCES USA CORPORATION** was the top operator before 2014, it is currently placed in the third rank as its average well EUR seems to be decreasing.

    "We should be mindful of interpreting the results. While it is nice for a drilling company to have a positive trend in its EUR per well over time, having a negative slope does not strongly mean that the company is going in the wrong direction. Based on the data, drastic changes in productions of some wells are evident. That might be due to refracking wells after a few years, leading to a sudden jump in production. That could increase the earlier EURs and decrease the slope of the curves."

    "While this analysis can be insightful, we should be mindful that the model may have not predicted wells with few data points (less than 1-2 years of history) accurately. LGA is more conservative compared to other models such as Arps and Duong models. I would have tested other models to see if I get consistent results, yet there is limited time given. A segmented model is also more suitable to use for wells with drastic changes in production.  \n",
    "Also, data from the recently drilled wells (most of the completions in 2018) were ignored in this analysis, which could have been influential, i.e., a change in the EUR trend. Ideally, we would like to build a robust model (like a bayesian one) that can make a good prediction even with just a few data points."

    "A bayesian approach (like mcmc) might eventually give the best results. However, that requires a lot more time to build an appropriate model (the run time is largely higher too). If I were to do bayesian analysis, I would establish a model based on good data first (here, wells with long production history and few outliers). Then I would use that model as my prior information on the other data to detect outliers first and then make predictions. Especially for those wells with very few data points a bayesian model can work best."
